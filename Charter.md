# WebAssembly System Interface Subgroup Charter

The System Interface Subgroup is a sub-organization of the
[WebAssembly Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) of the W3C.
As such, it is intended that its charter align with that of the CG. In particular, 
the sections of the [CG charter](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/) relating to
[Community and Business Group Process](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#process),
[Contribution Mechanics](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#contrib),
[Transparency](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#transparency), and
[Decision Process](https://webassembly.github.io/cg-charter/#decision) also apply to the Subgroup.

## Goals

The mission of this sugbroup is to provide a forum for pre-standardization
collaboration on a system interface API for WebAssembly programs.

## Scope

The Subgroup will consider topics related to system interface APIs, including:

- APIs for host filesystems, network stacks, and other resources.
- APIs for graphics, audio, input devices
- APIs for encryption, format conversion, and other transformations
  (particularly where hardware accelleration may be available on some platforms)


## Deliverables

### Specifications
The Subgroup may produce several kinds of specification-related work output:
- Creation of new specifications in standards bodies or working
groups (e.g. Wasm WG or TC39)
- Creation of new specifications outside of standards bodies
(e.g. similar to the LLVM object file format documentation in Wasm tool conventions)

### Non-normative reports
The Subgroup may produce non-normative material such as requirements
documents, recommendations, and use cases.

### Software
The Subgroup may produce software related to Wasm system interface APIs (either
as standalone libraries, tooling, or integration of interface-related
functionality in existing CG software such as Binaryen or WABT). Capabilities may
include:
- Libraries implementing external standard APIs in terms of WebAssembly
  System Interface APIs
- Tools for producing code that uses WebAssembly System Interface APIs
- Tools for implementing WebAssembly APIs
- Tools for debugging programs using WebAssembly System Interface APIs

## Amendments to this Charter and Chair Selection

This charter may be amended, and Subgroup Chairs may be selected by vote of the full
WebAssembly Community Group.
