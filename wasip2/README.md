# WASI Preview 2

## Introduction

WASI Preview 2 represents a major milestone for WASI. It marks the moment
when WASI has fully rebased on the [Wit IDL] and the [component model]
type system and semantics, making it modular, fully virtualizable, and
accessible to a wide variety of source languages.

WASI Preview 2 is also known as “WASI 0.2”, and corresponds to versions
numbered `0.2.x` in Wit packages and related identifiers. It is also known as
“WASIp2”, where the “p” stands for either “preview” or “point”.

## WASI Preview 2 Implementations

The portability criteria of the WASI Preview 2 proposals were met by the
following implementations, which were demonstrated to be interoperable by
each passing [Wasmtime's WASI Preview 2 test suite][test-suite].

[test-suite]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/test-programs/README.md

* [Wasmtime]
* [JCO]

[Wasmtime]: https://github.com/BytecodeAlliance/wasmtime
[JCO]: https://github.com/BytecodeAlliance/jco

We plan to promote the Preview 2 test suite to live in the [wasi-testsuite]
project soon, and add more interoperable implementations to this list when
they are complete.

## Proposal requirements for inclusion in WASI Preview 2.

To be included in Preview 2, a proposal must:

 - Reach phase 3 in the [WASI Subgroup Phase Process]
 - Satisfy its own [portability criteria]
 - Be voted for inclusion by the WASI Subgroup

Proposals may be added to WASI Preview 2 at any time until WASI Preview 3
is launched.

## Witx and Wit

Witx files can be derived from Wit files according to the Canonical ABI. Wasm
engines can implement single-module components using just these derived Witx files
and their existing Witx machinery.

## Looking forward to Preview 3

The component model is expected to add `future` and `stream` keywords, which
will provide integrated and composable `async` functionality. WASI Preview 3 is
planned to be a major revision of the Preview 2 APIs using these new features
in place of wasi-io's streams and polling interfaces. It's also expected to
incorporate lessons learned from implementation and user experience with
Preview 2.

When Preview 3 is launched, implementations may continue to support Preview 2,
either by implementing Preview 3 along side it, or by virtualizing (polyfilling)
Preview 2 in terms of Preview 3.

The release criteria of Preview 3 will include that performance will be measured
and addressed.
