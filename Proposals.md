# WASI proposals

WASI APIs are developed as proposals. These proposals go through 5 phases of development (following the [WebAssembly CG's Phase Process]).

You can learn more about contributing new proposals (and other ways to contribute) in our [Contributing] guide.

### Phase 1 - Feature Proposal (CG)

### Phase 0 - Pre-Proposal (CG)

**Note:** The pre-proposal phase is simply meant as a way to share ideas. This means that there may be overlap between pre-proposals. It also means that the WASI subgroup has not yet decided that the pre-proposal is in scope for WASI.

## Versioning

Once a proposal reaches Phase 3, we expect the champions to start creating releases, following the conventions of semantic versioning (semver). Releases for active proposals are linked in the chart above.

Proposals remain in the 0.x semver range until they reach Phase 5 and are fully standardized. At that point, a 1.0 release should be made available.

For some APIs, it makes sense to add new features after the API itself has reached Phase 5. These feature additions should go through the same standardization process. Once they have reached Phase 5, the minor version number of the release should be incremented.

Some APIs may require backwards-incompatible changes over time. In these cases, we allow proposals to increment the major version number _only if_ the old API can be implmented in terms of the new API. As part of the new version, champions are expected to provide a tool that enables this backwards-compatibility. If that is not possible, then a new API proposal with a new name should be started. The original API can then be deprecated over time if it makes sense to do so.
