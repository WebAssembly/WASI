# WebAssembly System Interface

![WASI](WASI.png)

The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a set of APIs for WASI being
developed for eventual standardization by the WASI Subgroup, which is a
subgroup of the WebAssembly Community Group.

WASI started with launching what is now called [Preview 1], an API using
the witx IDL, and it is now widely used. Its major influences are POSIX and
CloudABI.

[WASI Preview 2] is now in development, which is a modular collection of
APIs defined with the [Wit IDL], and it incorporates many of the lessons
learned from Preview 1, including adding support for a wider range of
source languages, modularity, a more expressive type system,
virtualizability, and more.

## Find the APIs

Development of each API happens in its own repo, which you can access
from the [proposals list](Proposals.md).

This repo is for general discussion, as well as documenting how we work
and high-level goals.

## Propose a new API

If you would like to create a new proposal, get started with our
[Contributing guide](Contributing.md).

All new API proposals should use the new format and the new repo structure that is shown in the [proposal template](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-proposal-template).

See the [Wit in WASI](docs/WitInWasi.md) document for more information about using Wit for WASI proposals.

## WASI High Level Goals

(In the spirit of [WebAssembly's High-Level Goals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/main/HighLevelGoals.md).)

1. Define a set of portable, modular, runtime-independent, and
   WebAssembly-native APIs which can be used by WebAssembly code to interact
   with the outside world. These APIs preserve the essential sandboxed nature of
   WebAssembly through a [Capability-based] API design.
2. Specify and implement incrementally. Start with a Minimum Viable Product
   (MVP), then adding additional features, prioritized by feedback and
   experience.
3. Supplement API designs with documentation and tests, and, when feasible,
   reference implementations which can be shared between wasm engines.
4. Make a great platform:
    * Work with WebAssembly tool and library authors to help them provide
      WASI support for their users.
    * When being WebAssembly-native means the platform isn't directly
      compatible with existing applications written for other platforms,
      design to enable compatibility to be provided by tools and libraries.
    * Allow the overall API to evolve over time; to make changes to API
      modules that have been standardized, build implementations of them
      using libraries on top of new API modules to provide compatibility.

## WASI Design Principles

### Capability-based security

WASI is designed with capability-based security principles, using the
facilities provided by the Wasm [component model]. All access to external
resources is provided by capabilities.

There are two kinds of capabilities:

 - Handles, defined in the [component-model type system], dynamically
   identify and provide access to resources. They are unforgeable, meaning
   there's no way for an instance to acquire access to a handle other than
   to have another instance explicitly pass one to it.

 - Link-time capabilities, which are functions which require no handle
   arguments, are used sparingly, in situations where it's not necessary
   to identify more than one instance of a resource at runtime. Link-time
   capabilities are *interposable*, so they are still refusable in a
   capability-based security sense.

WASI has no *ambient authorities*, meaning that there are no global
namespaces at runtime, and no global functions at link time.

[component-model type system]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md#type-definitions

Note that this is a different sense of "capability" than [Linux
capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
or the withdrawn [POSIX
capabilities](https://archive.org/details/posix_1003.1e-990310), which
are per-process rather than per-resource.

### Interposition

Interposition in the context of WASI interfaces is the ability for a
Webassembly instance to implement a given WASI interface, and for a
consumer WebAssembly instance to be able to use this implementation
transparently. This can be used to adapt or attenuate the functionality
of a WASI API without changing the code using it.

Component model interfaces always support link-time interposition. While
WASI APIs are often implemented in hosts, they can also be implemented
in Wasm, which may itself be a wrapper around the host. This may be used
to implement *attenuation*, providing filtered access to the underlying
host-provided functionality.

Interposition is sometimes referred to as "virtualization", however we
use "interposition" here because the word "virtualization" has several
related meanings.

### Compatibility

Compatibility with existing applications and libraries, as well as
existing host platforms, is important, but will sometimes be in conflict
with overall API cleanliness, safety, performance, or portability.
Where practical, WASI seeks to keep the WASI API itself free of
compatibility concerns, and provides compatibility through libraries,
such as WASI libc, and tools. This way, applications which don't require
compatibility for compatibility's sake aren't burdened by it.

### Portability

Portability is important to WASI, however the meaning of portability
will be specific to each API.

WASI's modular nature means that engines don't need to implement every
API in WASI, so we don't need to exclude APIs just because some host
environments can't implement them. We prefer APIs which can run across
a wide variety of engines when feasible, but we'll ultimately decide
whether something is "portable enough" on an API-by-API basis.

### Modularity

WASI will include many interfaces that are not appropriate for every host
environment, so WASI uses the component model's worlds mechanism to allow
specific sets of APIs to be described which meet the needs of different
environments.
