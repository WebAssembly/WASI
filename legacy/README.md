# Legacy WASI docs

In the early days of WASI, we developed design ideas around the ABI and imports. These ideas have made their way into the WebAssembly component model, though sometimes in a greatly modified form.

We will continue to keep these documents in the repo through the end of 2023. After that point, we expect all WASI implmentations to be implmented in terms of the new design.
