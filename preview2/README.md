# WASI Preview 2

At this time, Preview 2 is in development and has not yet launched.

## Launch criteria

WASI Preview 2 will be considered launched when at least two independent
proposals which define worlds, and all their dependencies, have met the
requirements for inclusion listed below, and the WASI Subgroup has voted
to launch it.

## Introduction

*The following is a draft of an introduction for WASI Preview 2 when it launches.*

WASI Preview 2 represents a major milestone for WASI. It marks the moment
when WASI has fully rebased on the [Wit IDL] and the [component model]
type system and semantics, making it modular, fully virtualizable, and
accessible to a wide variety of source languages.
