Meeting notes:

DG: WASI Snapshot 1 is out.

DG: WASI-SDK and WASI-libc. Currently in Cranestation orginization. They will move under the WebAssembly orginization, that was approved at the last CG meeting. We just have to work out some minor licensing issues for that to move forward.

DG: Modularization update. I don’t have an update, haven’t had enough time. The current PR shows the shape of it, but it needs to be updated to the current set of APIs and witx.

DG: Call for volunteers. I want to emphasize that WASI is a big opportunity, and now is the time to make changes. Please make PRs against the ephemeral directory
