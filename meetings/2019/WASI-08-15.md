    1. Interface description based on Module types
        - https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/74
        - This is a rough sketch, similar to WatIDL, but stripped down, and is
          meant to be just enough to let us start describing API proposals.
    1. Meeting time
        - I received a request from someone who would like to present a proposal to hold a meeting at an APAC-friendly time.
        - We have been following the CG which held some APAC-friendly meeting times for a while but
          [dropped them due to low attendance](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/blob/master/2018/CG-04-03.md#drop-apac-timezone).
        - Assuming this works for the presenter, move the time of the next meeting to 08-30 at 06:00â€“07:00 UTC? (This is 08-29 at 11:00pm in Pacific Time)?
