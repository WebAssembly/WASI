Meeting notes:

Whole-program LTO coming:
https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/pull/134
Smaller binary size, optimization of combining libraries with Wasm binary (for example libc)
Frame-buffer API:
https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/229
The process for designing and submitting new API proposals is still being figured out, so in addition to the proposal, let's also talk about what we can do to make the process easier.
Aaron: Idea: add a short and sweet markdown document laying out the steps for a proposal
Aaron: I wouldn’t mind writing this up. It’s already pretty much already in my PR. So it’s just cleaning that up and we would be good to go :)
Josh Triplett’s talk at Wasm SF was helpful, but a bit outdated even though it was only given a few months ago.



Crypto API!
https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/231
What criteria should we apply?
We can also talk about process.
Being developed to support running wasm within a trusted execution environment, but intending this crypto API to have broader use cases.
Enarx: https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki
Prerequisite for sockets support
Lots of interest in sockets support.
Sockets dependency on merging read/write with send/recv?
Don’t over-rotate on POSIX.
How much appetite should we have for prototyping?
Feature flags are a great way to support this
Declare ahead of time what the process is.
Maybe it’s ok to use alternate names, as long as we document what’s going to happen. And maybe use polyfills to ease transitions.
Action item: Dan to write up a brief README for how to prototype a new feature. Also add things to watch out for.
Separate experimental repo? Directory? Maybe just put features in ephemeral/snapshot 
Back on read/write - we don’t want to over-rotate on POSIX, but we do want a general read/write? We are heavily influenced by POSIX here.
